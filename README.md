# Deploy-ML-model using flask and access via flutter 

#### This is a repository showing how to deploy ML models using flask and access it using a rest api from flutter 

Machine Learning has become one of the cool technologies in the recent times, almost every software product out in market uses ML in one or the other way. Letâ€™s see how to build an application that can upload images to server and make predictions on it (image classification ). These images can be accessed by an app and you can simply search an image by its content.
We will use Flask (Python framework) as back end for our REST API, Flutter for mobile app and Keras for image classification. We will also use MongoDB as our database to store data about the images and classify images using Keras ResNet50 model.
